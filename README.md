# Hi there! 👋 I'm Haletha "Letha" Judkins

I'm a passionate technical writer with a love for crafting clear and concise documentation. My journey in the tech world goes beyond words – I enjoy getting hands-on with code and diving into the intricacies of various programming languages.

## 🚀 What I Do

- **Technical Writing:** I specialize in creating documentation that bridges the gap between complex technical concepts and user-friendly content. From API guides to tutorials, I strive to make every piece of documentation informative and accessible.

- **Coding Aspirations:** I'm interested in going beyond documenting code. In the near future, I'd like to actively contribute to codebases. I believe that understanding the development process firsthand enhances my ability to create effective documentation.

- **Continuous Learning:** My interest in programming started in college when I learned BASIC as part of my undergraduate curriculum. After college, I enrolled in C++ and Java courses. Currently, I'm halfway through Harvard University's rigorous CS50 [Introduction to Computer Science]( https://www.harvardonline.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) online course to refresh my knowledge and understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, SQL, and C. I've also started their [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-artificial-intelligence-python) online course to learn more about a hot topic in technology. I'm always hungry to learn new programming languages and technologies. Whether it's diving into a new framework or exploring the depths of a language's syntax, I find joy in expanding my technical toolkit.
